  description: The process of contacting and hiring photography begins with the
    client sending basic details about the desired service via email or social
    media. The photographer responds with information about availability, prices
    and portfolio examples. After discussing details such as location, date and
    specific needs, the client receives a formal proposal and a contract to
    sign. The reservation is confirmed with an initial payment, and the
    photographer guides the preparations until the day of the session. Finally,
    the edited material is delivered within the agreed deadline, ensuring a
    professional and personalized experience.
